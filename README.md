### Apollo iOS Pagination

This repo provides an API way to handle paginated queries for Apollo iOS.

`ApolloPagination` uses an `ApolloClient` to fetch and cache your paginated query data. It supports:

- Reading/Writing paginated data with an Apollo `NormalizedCache`
- Watching paginated data for changes
- Forward, Reverse, and Bi-directional pagination
- Cursor-based, offset-based, and custom pagination mechanisms

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in [Pagination](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/pagination/introduction/) on Apollo's documentation website.

## Who is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) builds open-source software and a graph platform to unify GraphQL across your apps and services. We help you ship faster with:

- [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/studio/develop/) – A free, end-to-end platform for managing your GraphQL lifecycle. Track your GraphQL schemas in a hosted registry to create a source of truth for everything in your graph. Studio provides an IDE (Apollo Explorer) so you can explore data, collaborate on queries, observe usage, and safely make schema changes.
- [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-federation) – The industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed graph. Use Apollo’s gateway to compose a unified graph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client/) – The most popular GraphQL client for the web. Apollo also builds and maintains [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) and [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) – A production-ready JavaScript GraphQL server that connects to any microservice, API, or database. Compatible with all popular JavaScript frameworks and deployable in serverless environments.
